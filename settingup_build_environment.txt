IB_PTrader

How to build
------------

The project was originally built with Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (note you will getting a missing 
afxcontrolbars.h error with a pre SP1 VS2008).

It is possible to build with a later version of VS, but you will need to use the v90 platform toolset,
(ib_ptrader property pages Configuration Properties/General/Platform Toolset set to v90).

If you use a later toolset (such as v100, v110_xp, v110, v120_xp or v120) you may encounter the following build issues:-
1) missing afxwin.h error - MFC is not installed (VS2008 Express does not include MFC)
2) build errors concerning the type XMLCh (part of xerces xml parser)
3) a COFF error on linking

These different errors seem to vary depending on the OS being built under/different Service Packs applied
to Visual Studio. Even if the project successfully builds the MySQL connector (mysqlcppconn.dll) will generally fault. 
It may be possible to build with a later toolset if you also rebuild both the Xerces XML parser and MySQL Connector 
(and maybe Chart Director) with the same toolset. I haven't tried this so I cannot confirm if it would work.

The project can only be built in a Release configuration. This is because of problems with the IB API. The Release configuration
is built with a program database setting enabled in order to allow debugging.

Unfortunately due to the use of 3rd party software the instructions for setting up a build and runtime environment
are quite complicated. The following items need to be installed:-

IB TWS (you will need an IB account to run, but not to build)
IB API (install to c:\tws api)
MySQL
MySQL Connector C++ (1.1.3)
MySQL .NET Connector (ver 6.8.3)
Boost (install to C:\boost_1_55_0)
Chart Director (install to C:\chartdir_cpp_win32)
Xerces XML parser (install to C:\xerces-c-3.1.1-x86-windows-vc-9.0)
IB_PTrader source code (copy to c:\ib_ptrader)

The solution assumes boost, chart director, xerces, ib_ptrader source code are all
located on the C: hard drive.

IB TWS
------

goto https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/?f=674&ib_entity=uk 
and download TWS for Windows

IB API
------

goto http://interactivebrokers.github.io/# and press "I Agree"
download IB API for Windows API 9.70
Note due changes IB may have made to headers downloading any other version
of the API may cause build errors. Install to c:\tws api

MySQL
-----

goto http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/
and download MySQL Installer 5.6.17 for 32 bit. 
When installing enable the "skip the check for updates" option as this
installs later versions of MySQL software.

As well as the MySQL server and workbench
ensure you install MySQL Connector C++ 1.1.3 and .NET Connector 6.8.3. Picking the
"Developer Default" option will ensure this.

Note on 64 bit OSes the installer will install the 64 bit versions by default,
ensure that you select the 32 bit editions. On a 64 bit OS select the "Custom"
option and on the next screen change the Architecture setting to 32 bit.

Boost
-----

Boost is needed to build with the MySQL C++ connector
goto http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_55_0.html
download the windows version and install to c:\boost_1_55_0

Chart Director
--------------

goto http://www.advsofteng.com/download.html 
goto "ChartDirector for C++" section and download Windows (32-bit) version - 
read the section marked "unblock the ZIP file" in the description,
extract to the C: drive

Xerces XML parser
-----------------

goto http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi
download the 32 bit binary distribution - xerces-c-3.1.1-x86-windows-vc-9.0.zip
and extract to C:

IB_PTrader Source Code
----------------------

The source tree is c:\ib_ptrader which contains the .cpp/.h/project files. The resource
files are stored in the res directory.

Below are the include and lib paths in the project. If you download different versions of the above
software you will have to change the paths accordingly. Note depending on which installer is used
the C++ connector can be installed to either "C:\Program Files\MySQL\Connector C++ 1.1.3"
or to "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Connector C++ 1.1.3". Also note if MySQL has been installed on
a 64 bit platform then all the "Program Files" part of the paths become "Programs Files (x86)".
