IB_PTrader GUI
--------------

All the jpg files mentioned in this document are located in the ScreenShots directory.

When the app is launched its appearance is as shown in 1st_startup.jpg

The top pane displays all the tickers/quotes. The pane beneath displays status messages.

Before trading can commence the share data must be loaded. The file settingup_runtime_environment.txt
describes how to create XML buy/sell order data for importing.

On the bottom row to the left there are 3 buttons:-

"DB"
----

Read buy/sell orders from the database


"DB/XML"
--------

Read and merge buy/sell orders from the database/XML


"XML"
-----

Read orders from XML

One of these 3 buttons must be pressed to load the data. If you're adding new share 
data via XML then press "DB/XML" or "XML". Note the "XML" option deletes the current 
database data first (the contents of the deals table). If you're just loading 
existing data from the database then press "DB".

After the data has loaded the appearance will be as shown as in 2nd_dataloaded.jpg
The shares shown in this example were created using the eg.bat file in the DB directory.
See the "PShare/PGen Examples" section in the settingup_runtime_environment.txt file for details.

When choosing the "DB/XML", "XML" options a large amount of data can be created on the heap which
is then deleted. It is recommended to restart the app after this and then use the "DB" option.
This reduces the amount of heap fragmentation that might happen when deleting very large data sets. 


"Go!"
----- 

Initially the app is in a stopped state (ie no trading is allowed. In this mode the app will still 
process any orders that have just been executed by TWS). The window title shows "(STOPPED)" on 
the end. Pressing "Go!" enables trading and the text of the button changes to "Stop".


Ticker Display
--------------

Below is example of a ticker displayed in the quotes pane:-

aP_20:00<*#LNKD=176.42 (3), 176.84 (8) 10K, AvS=176.12>, 176.00 (B), **181.00 (B_5_7.25), 186.00 (a) --> (LOW 183.25), OI=10 - <176.42 to 176.75, 176.84 to 177.32> - B=$0.00 (2000.00)
^        ^      ^           ^          ^        ^                    ^                            ^                ^                                                  ^

|        |                                      to IB                the offer             already bought,                                                            bought so far.
|        |                                                                                 P - pending, awaiting

|        * means only buy if share offer price is below IB's average
|        # means allow early buys
|
|
means auto liquidate is set for this share. Liquidate all LNKD shares in
profit at 20:00pm (UK time) - 15:00 US Market time.


The buttons from top/left are as follows:-

"D Quotes"
----------

Dumps the contents of the quotes pane to a file. The name of the file is displayed in the status message pane


"D Mess"
--------

Dumps the contents of the messages pane to a file


"Internal Data"
---------------

Dumps app internal data to a file - for debugging purposes only.


"Kill All", "Kill Buy", "Kill Sell"
-----------------------------------

These buttons cancel orders. The order id is entered in the edit field to the
right. Note this doesn't kill orders in TWS. This feature is used when TWS executes an order
but doesn't send a confirmation message to IB_PTrader. This can happen if IB_PTrader is
offline or if TWS has data feed issues. The order id for an outstanding order is shown
when the "Orders" button is pressed.


"Stats"
-------

Displays stats


"Stats File"
------------

Dumps stats to a file


"Orders"
--------

Displays the currently active orders


"?", "Goto Active", "Goto InActive", "Goto Buy", "Goto Sell"
------------------------------------------------------------

The next 5 buttons concern the status of an individual ticker. A share (ticker) has 5 possible states:-

Active - can both buy and sell shares
InActive - no selling or buying of shares
SellOnly - only sell shares
BuyOnly - only buy shares
DISABLED - same as inactive but no price feed is requested and user cannot change the state in the GUI

These 5 buttons allow the user to change the state of currently selected ticker in the ticker pane. This
is shown in 3rd_statusbuttons.jpg


"Quit"
------

Quits the app. Note you will be asked to confirm if there are any outstanding buy/sell orders.


"Data"
------

This displays a dialog which shows account/portfolio data sent to the app from TWS.


"Scroll"
--------

Scrolls the messages pane to the end.


"Clear"
-------

Clears the messages pane


"U Quotes"
----------

Unselects the currently selected ticker in the ticker pane


"U Mess"
--------

Unselects the currently selected line in the messages pane


"T Liquid", "Liquidate"
-----------------------

These buttons have 2 modes, a display mode and an action mode.

If the edit field is empty then display mode is used. "T Liquid" - only displays trades done today.
"Liquidate" displays all trades.

In display mode a list of all currently bought shares is shown, split into profit/loss categories.

In action mode if the edit field contains a "P" or a "p" then all shares (for the currently selected ticker)
that are in profit will liquidated. In action mode you always be asked to confirm the action.
"LL" or "ll" - liquidate shares currently at a loss
"AA" or "aa" - liquidate all shares

These liquidate options complement the automatic liquidate feature (see howtoconfig_app_in_source_code.txt for details)


The next button toggles if the app is allowed to buy shares that are below IB's cost average for the share
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


"Batch Buy"
-----------

When this is enabled the app makes a batch buy for a ticker. Batch buys are only available
when there is a daily buy limit specified for the ticker (see howtoconfig_app_in_source_code.txt for details)

Consider the following buy points:-

$20 (sell at $22), $25 (sell at $27), $30 (sell at $32), $35 (sell at $37)

normally the lowest buy price for the 25 buy point would be $20.01, $25.01 for 30, $30.01 for 35
If batch buy is enabled and the buy day limit is sufficient an offer of 20.01 would mean
the 25, 30, 35 buy points would be filled. When the bid hit $37 then the maximum possible profit
on the 35 buy point would be (37 - 20.01 = 16.99) instead of (37 - 30.01 = 6.99).


"Batch Check"
-------------

This displays a message box showing all the buy points that would be filled if batch buy was enabled. If
a value is entered in the edit field the code uses this value else it uses the max buy limit for the share
for the day.


Context Menus
-------------

Right clicking on a ticker displays a context menu as seen in 4th_contextmenu.jpg
In the screenshot note the 2500 entered in the edit field and how it affects the options in the menu.

If "live prices" are set for a ticker (see howtoconfig_app_in_source_code.txt for details), it is possible to view a live
chart for today's prices. See 5th_contextmenu.jpg and 6th_livechart.jpg.

In the context menu you can change buy/sell limits for a share and can change the automatic liquidations for the
share. For the liquidations the value in the edit box is the liquidate time eg 2053 would mean liquidate at 20:53.


Double Click
------------

Double clicking on a ticker displays a message box as shown in 7th_doubleclick.jpg
